# coldenough
Find out if its cold enough outside to store your beer.  Node, Express, Superagent, React

To use you need an api key from http://api.wunderground.com.  Put that key into a env var called WUNDER_API or whatever you want to call it as long as you change the value in server.js.

Npm install and run node server.js or nodemon server.js (nodemon is better).

Enter your zip code and you should receive a text message letting you know the temp and if you can leave your beer outside.

Enjoy!
